# text-direction-override package

This package allows to force text direction for right to left written languages like Hebrew.

# keys

1. [ctrl + alt + left] Force left to right direction
2. [ctrl + alt + right] Disable override

# known bugs / todos:

1. Does not work when shadow DOM is enabled.
2. Does not work on splitted panels.
3. Currently there is no key to force right to left direction because in this mode text is uneditable (use menu to do this).
