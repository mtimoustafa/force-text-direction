# force-text-direction package

_Originally by Robert Kałamański. I forked this and then the original repo was deleted._

This package allows to force text direction for right to left written languages like Hebrew.

# hot-keys

1. [ctrl + alt + left] Force left to right direction
2. [ctrl + alt + right] Disable override

# known bugs / todos:

1. Does not work when shadow DOM is enabled.
2. Currently there is no hot-key to force right to left direction because in this mode text is uneditable (use menu to do this).
